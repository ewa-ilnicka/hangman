## About The Project

<img src="logo.png" alt="View">

There are many great Hangman tutorials available on the Internet and I decided to learn from one made by Kodilla - programming school with many bootcamps and courses for young programmers.


### Built With
To built this project I used:
* [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)
* [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)
* [Java Script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)


## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

To open index.html you need any browser (altough I don't recommend Internet Explorer).

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
```
or download ZIP.

2. Open index.html with any browser.

3. Have fun playing the game.



## Usage

There are three categories with a few words. In the tutorial there were diffrent words so I decided to change them (also with categories) to these that I'm interested in.
